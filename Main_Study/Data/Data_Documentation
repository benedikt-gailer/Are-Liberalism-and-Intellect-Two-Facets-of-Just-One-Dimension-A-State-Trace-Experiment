1. Experimental Conditions

There are six experimental conditions. Experimental Conditions differ in the described personality traits
of the vignette person:
1 = Low self-efficacy, high artistic interests
2 = High self-efficacy, low artistic interests
3 = Low self-efficacy, moderate artistic interests
4 = High self-efficacy, moderate artistic interests
5 = High self-efficacy, high artistic interersts
6 = Low self-efficacy, low artistic interests

In Main_Data.csv, these conditions are keyed as:
1 = C10O1
2 = C11O0
3 = C10OM
4 = C11OM
5 = C11O1
6 = C10O0


Every Subject goes through all six of them (withn-subject design).
However, the first experimental condition subjects go through is analysed seperately. If only the first
conditions subjects underwent are analysed, the data can be treated as between-subject data. 


2. IPIP-NEO-120 (Johnson, 2014) scale items used

There are four scales being used: Liberalism, Intellect, Self-efficacy, and Artistic interests
For the vignette ratings (DVs and manipulation check), only Liberalism, Intellect, Item C05 
(from self-efficacy) and item O89 (from artistic interests) were used. All scales and items were used in subject's 
self-assessments. In the following table, each IPIP-NEO-120 item is paired with the correpsonding response
key in Data_Main.csv: 


Liberalism		Self-efficacy	

item O28 =  SQ002 	item C35 = SQ016		
item O58 =  SQ004	item C65 = SQ012		
item O88 =  SQ006	item C95 = SQ013		
item O118 = SQ008	item C05 = SQ009		

Intellect		Artistic interests

item O23 =  SQ001	O98 = SQ010
item O53 =  SQ003	O08 = SQ92900
item O83 =  SQ005	O38 = SQ015
item O113 = SQ007	O68 = SQ43802



3. General Structure of the Data


Columns 1 - 5: 	   Survey Metadata
Columns 6 - 7: 	   Informed Consent
Column 8:      	   Interim Screen
Column 9:      	   First experimental Condition Subjects go through
Columns 10 - 69:   Subject's vignette ratings for the first experimental condition they went through:
		   If a condition was not went through first, but later in the experiment, values are NA.
		   I.e. only those columns corresponding to the subjets' first conditions have values

	Columns 10 - 19: Condition 1
	Columns 20 - 29: Condition 2
	Columns 30 - 39: Condition 3
	Columns 40 - 49: Condition 4
	Columns 50 - 59: Condition 5
	Columns 60 - 69: Condition 6

Column 70:	   First Attention Check Question 
Column 71 - 154:   Subject's vignette ratings for all following experimental conditions (Following 
		   the first presented one). For Condition 1,2,5 and 6, subjects were either presented
		   a version including attention check items, or one without. Regularly, subjects
		   were presented Vignettes including attention checks in Conditions 2 and 5. If 2 or 5
		   was already presented as the first vignette, attention checks were presented for Conditions
		   1 or 6

	Columns 71 - 80:   Condition 1
	Columns 81 - 91:   Condition 1 including an attention check item (SQ011)
	Columns 92 - 102:  Condition 2 including an attention check item (SQ011)
	Columns 103 - 112: Condition 3 
	Columns 113 - 122: Condition 4
	Columns 123 - 133: Condition 5 including an attention check item (SQ011)
	Columns 134 - 144: Condition 6 including an attention check item (SQ011)
	Columns 145 - 154: Condition 6
