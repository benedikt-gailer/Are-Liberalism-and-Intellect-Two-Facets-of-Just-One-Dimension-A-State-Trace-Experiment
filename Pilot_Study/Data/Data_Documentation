3. General structure of the data



1. Experimental Conditions

There are four experimental conditions. Experimental Conditions differ in the described personality traits
of the vignette person:
1 = Low self-efficacy, high artistic interests
2 = High self-efficacy, low artistic interests
3 = High self-efficacy, high artistic interersts
4 = Low self-efficacy, low artistic interests

In Data_Pilot.csv, these conditions are keyed as:
1 = C10O1
2 = C11O0
3 = C11O1
4 = C10O0


Every Subject responds to one out of the four experimental conditions (between-subject design)


2. IPIP-NEO-120 (Johnson, 2014) scale items used

There are two scales being used: Liberalism and Intellect. Additionally, one item each from the
Self-efficacy and Artistic interests scales were used for a manipulation check.
In the following table, each IPIP-NEO-120 item is paired with the correpsonding response
key in Data_Pilot.csv: 


Liberalism		Self-efficacy	

item O28 =  SQ002 	item C05 = SQ009
item O58 =  SQ004		
item O88 =  SQ006			
item O118 = SQ008			

Intellect		Artistic interests

item O23 =  SQ001	item O89 = SQ010
item O53 =  SQ003
item O83 =  SQ005
item O113 = SQ007



3. General Structure of the data


Columns 1 - 5: 	   Survey Metadata
Columns 6 - 9: 	   Demographics
	Column 6:  Gender (AO01 = female, AO02 = male)
	Column 7:  Open text field (if neither male nor female)
	Column 8:  Check if 18yo or older (AO01 = yes)
	Column 9:  Age

Column 10:	   Random integer from (1 or 2)
Column 11: 	   Experimental Condition
Columns 12 - 51:   Subject's vignette ratings. Because it was a between-subject design,
		   subjects only went through one experimental condition. Therefore, 
		   All columns corresponding to conditions a subject has not went through
		   Contain NAs.

	Columns 12 -21: Condition 1
	Columns 22 -31: Condition 2
	Columns 32 -41: Condition 3
	Columns 42 -51: Condition 4 

Column  52: 	   Comment
Column  53:        Consent before sending Data
Columns 54 - 70:   Timings
